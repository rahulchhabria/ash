# Subsystems

> Modular components with clear boundaries, defined interfaces, and isolated responsibilities

## Intent

Subsystems solve the problem of complexity growth. As the codebase expands, tight coupling makes changes risky and testing difficult. Subsystems provide:

1. **Clear boundaries** - Each subsystem owns a specific domain with defined responsibilities
2. **Stable interfaces** - Consumers depend on public API, not implementation details
3. **Isolated testing** - Subsystems can be tested independently with mocked dependencies
4. **Maintainability** - Changes inside a subsystem don't ripple across the codebase

A subsystem is NOT:
- A microservice (subsystems live in the same process)
- A plugin (subsystems are core functionality, not optional extensions)
- Just a directory (subsystems have explicit contracts)

## Extension Boundaries

Ash has two different extension layers and they are intentionally not equivalent:

1. **Primary capabilities (first-party)**: implemented in core subsystems/integrations.
   These are trusted host features and may use internal runtime wiring/hooks.
2. **Third-party extensions**: implemented as skills. Skills are the public extension
   point and must use stable host surfaces (`use_skill`, `ash-sb`, RPC/capabilities),
   not direct integration hook wiring.

Implication: adding a new first-party product capability may justify subsystem/
integration changes; adding third-party behavior should generally be done through
skills and capability APIs.

## Outcomes

### Each subsystem has a single responsibility

| Subsystem | Responsibility | NOT responsible for |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| memory | Long-term fact storage and retrieval | Conversation history, session state |
| sessions | Conversation persistence and context | Fact extraction, semantic search |
| scheduling | Deferred task execution | Task content, routing |
| todos | Canonical todo lifecycle and list management | Job execution orchestration |
| images | Inbound image understanding + context extraction | Message transport, LLM orchestration |
| browser | Session-scoped page actions and artifacts (sandbox provider runs in container runtime) | Message transport, model orchestration |
| capabilities | Host-managed sensitive external operations with verified identity and scoped auth state | Prompt orchestration, provider message transport |

### Consumers use public API only

Imports should come from the subsystem root, not internal modules:

```python
# Good - public API
from ash.memory import MemoryManager, create_memory_manager

# Avoid - internal implementation
from ash.memory.store import MemoryStore
```

Internal components may be exposed for advanced composition but are not part of the stable contract.

### Subsystems are independently testable

Each subsystem can be tested with:
- Mocked dependencies (database, LLM, other subsystems)
- Real dependencies in integration tests
- No reliance on other subsystems' internals

### Dependencies flow one direction

```
core/agent.py  →  subsystem/  →  db/models.py
                              →  llm/
tools/         →  subsystem/
cli/           →  subsystem/
```

Subsystems:
- MAY depend on foundational layers (db, llm, config)
- MUST NOT depend on other subsystems directly
- MUST NOT depend on core/agent (that's the orchestrator)

When subsystems need to interact, the agent orchestrates or events are used.

## Structure

Each subsystem follows a consistent layout:

```
src/ash/{subsystem}/
    __init__.py        # Public API with docstring
    types.py           # Public types (dataclasses, enums)
    manager.py         # Primary facade + factory function
    {internal}.py      # Implementation modules
```

### `__init__.py` - Public contract

Documents what consumers can depend on:

```python
"""One-line description.

Public API:
- PrimaryManager: Main entry point
- create_primary_manager: Factory function

Types:
- PublicType1, PublicType2

Internal (for composition):
- InternalComponent1, InternalComponent2
"""

from ash.{subsystem}.manager import PrimaryManager, create_primary_manager
from ash.{subsystem}.types import PublicType1, PublicType2

__all__ = [...]
```

### Factory function

Encapsulates internal wiring so consumers don't need to know about components:

```python
async def create_memory_manager(
    db_session: AsyncSession,
    llm_registry: LLMRegistry,
    ...
) -> MemoryManager:
    """Create fully-wired manager."""
    # Internal wiring hidden from consumers
```

### Types in `types.py`

Public types live in one place, not scattered across implementation files:
- Dataclasses for results and context
- Enums for status/state
- TypedDicts for complex parameters

## Current Subsystems

| scheduling | Complete | [specs/schedule.md](schedule.md) |
| todos | Complete | [specs/todos.md](todos.md) |
| browser | Complete | [specs/browser.md](browser.md) |
| capabilities | Contract (planned) | [specs/capabilities.md](capabilities.md) |

## Verification

For each subsystem:

- [ ] Has outcome-focused spec in `specs/`
- [ ] Public API documented in `__init__.py`
- [ ] Types centralized in `types.py`
- [ ] Factory function for wiring
- [ ] Tests pass with mocked dependencies
- [ ] No imports from other subsystems
- [ ] Consumers import from root, not internal modules

## Integration Hooks

The runtime harness uses integration hooks to keep core wiring light and deterministic.
Contributor implementation details live in [specs/integrations.md](integrations.md).

### Harness responsibilities (MUST)

The harness MAY only:

1. Build base runtime primitives (config, workspace, LLM/tool executors, registries).
2. Install integration contributors in deterministic order.
3. Run lifecycle and integration hook pipelines.

The harness MUST NOT encode feature-specific orchestration logic as ad-hoc branches.

### Hook categories

Integration contributors SHOULD expose one or more of:

- `setup`: build/initialize integration state.
- `on_startup` / `on_shutdown`: runtime lifecycle hooks.
- `preprocess_incoming_message`: transform inbound provider message before session/agent processing.
- `augment_prompt_context`: contribute structured context data.
- `augment_skill_instructions`: append extra instruction lines when a bundled skill is invoked.
- `register_sandbox_cli`: expose sandbox CLI surface.
- `register_rpc_methods`: register RPC handlers.
- `on_message_postprocess`: run post-turn integration work.

If an integration has post-turn behavior, it MUST be implemented via
`on_message_postprocess` in the integration runtime pipeline. Core agent/provider
entrypoints MUST NOT call integration-specific post-turn logic directly.

### Prompt integration rule (MUST)

Prompt hooks MUST contribute structured data only. Prompt rendering remains centralized
in prompt-building code. Hooks MUST NOT inject prompt text fragments directly.

### Ordered pipeline rule (MUST)

When multiple contributors implement the same hook, execution MUST be deterministic via
an explicit order/priority.

### Shared composition path (MUST)

Runtime entrypoints and eval harnesses MUST compose integrations through the same
composition flow. Evals are not a separate wiring model.

Integration hooks are part of trusted host composition. They are not a third-party
plugin surface.

### Testing requirements (MUST)

Each integration MUST provide:

- Unit tests for hook behavior.
- Architecture tests that enforce harness boundaries and disallow direct feature wiring
  outside approved integration entrypoints.

## Integration Compliance Checklist

For each new capability/integration:

- [ ] Implements integration hooks for required surfaces.
- [ ] Registers via harness composition path (not ad-hoc feature branches).
- [ ] Uses structured prompt augmentation only.
- [ ] Includes unit tests for hook logic.
- [ ] Includes/updates architecture guard tests.
- [ ] Adds code comments at boundaries referencing this spec.

## Adding An Integration

When introducing a new integration:

1. Define the contributor with explicit `name` and `priority`.
2. Implement only the hooks it needs (`setup`, lifecycle, prompt/env, postprocess, RPC).
3. Register it through shared composition (`create_default_integrations` + `compose_integrations`).
4. Add a runtime test that validates hook order and side effects.
5. Add or update architecture guard tests if ownership boundaries change.
