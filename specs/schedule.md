# Schedule System

Graph-native task scheduling backed by `ash.graph` nodes and edges.

## Status: Implemented

## Overview

The schedule system allows the agent to schedule future tasks using sandbox CLI commands (`ash schedule create`). The commands go through RPC to the host process, which writes schedule entries into graph storage. A background watcher triggers entries when due, processes them through the agent, and routes responses back.

**Key principle:** Canonical state lives in `ash.graph` and is extensible via node/edge schema registration.

## Graph Storage

Location: `~/.ash/graph/`

```
~/.ash/graph/
├── schedules.jsonl      # schedule_entry nodes
└── edges.jsonl          # includes schedule scope edges
```

Registered schedule edges:
- `SCHEDULE_FOR_CHAT`: `schedule_entry -> chat`
- `SCHEDULE_FOR_USER`: `schedule_entry -> user`

Edge targets MUST be graph node UUIDs (not raw provider IDs). Use
`resolve_user_node_id` / `resolve_chat_node_id` from `ash.graph.edges` to
bridge a provider-specific identifier to the canonical node ID before creating
edges. Legacy edges with provider_id targets are migrated to graph node UUIDs
at next write via `_migrate_legacy_edges`.

`ScheduleEntry.user_id` and `ScheduleEntry.chat_id` store **provider IDs**
(needed for message routing to the correct chat/user). Edges store graph node
UUIDs for scope traversal. This intentional split means edges are authoritative
for ownership/scope queries, while node fields are authoritative for routing.

Legacy migration:
- Import migration from `~/.ash/schedule.jsonl` into graph storage is upgrade-owned (`ash upgrade`).
- Runtime read/write semantics are graph-native.

### One-Shot Entries

Execute once at a specific time, then deleted from graph storage:

```json
{"trigger_at": "2026-01-12T09:00:00Z", "message": "Check the build", "chat_id": "123456", "provider": "telegram", "user_id": "789", "created_at": "2026-01-11T10:00:00Z"}
```

### Periodic Entries

Execute on a cron schedule, `last_run` updated in graph storage after each execution:

```json
{"cron": "0 8 * * *", "message": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "123456", "provider": "telegram", "user_id": "789"}
```

After execution:
```json
{"cron": "0 8 * * *", "message": "Daily summary", "chat_id": "123456", "provider": "telegram", "last_run": "2026-01-12T08:00:00Z"}
```

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | No | Stable 8-char hex identifier |
| `message` | string | Yes | Task/message to execute |
| `trigger_at` | ISO 8601 | One-shot | When to trigger (UTC) |
| `cron` | string | Periodic | Cron expression (5-field) |
| `timezone` | string | No | IANA timezone name for cron evaluation |
| `chat_id` | string | Yes | Chat to send response to |
| `chat_title` | string | No | Friendly name for the chat |
| `provider` | string | Yes | Provider name (e.g., "telegram") |
| `user_id` | string | No | User who scheduled the task |
| `username` | string | No | @mention name for responses |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 | No | When the task was created |
| `last_run` | ISO 8601 | No | Last execution time (periodic only) |

## Cron Format

Standard 5-field cron: `minute hour day month weekday`

Examples:
- `0 8 * * *` - Daily at 8 AM
- `0 9 * * 1` - Mondays at 9 AM
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
- `0 0 1 * *` - First of each month at midnight

## Sandbox CLI (`ash-sb schedule`)

The agent uses sandbox CLI commands to manage entries. These commands communicate with the host process via RPC (`schedule.create`, `schedule.list`, `schedule.cancel`, `schedule.update`).

The commands automatically inject `chat_id`, `user_id`, `provider`, and `timezone` from signed `ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN` claims.

**Note:** Scheduling only works from providers with persistent chats (e.g., Telegram). Cannot schedule from CLI.

**Design principle:** Output is optimized for LLM consumption — every response includes enough context for the agent to verify correctness and report results to the user. Timezone, next fire time, and task message are always shown.

### `ash-sb schedule create`

```bash
# One-time task (natural language or ISO 8601)
ash-sb schedule create "Check the build" --at "tomorrow at 9am"
ash-sb schedule create "Check the build" --at 2026-01-12T09:00:00Z

# Recurring task
ash-sb schedule create "Daily summary" --cron "0 8 * * *"

# With explicit timezone (overrides token timezone default)
ash-sb schedule create "Standup" --cron "0 10 * * 1-5" --tz America/New_York
```

**One-shot output:**
```
Scheduled reminder (id=a1b2c3d4)
  Time: Sat 2026-02-21 14:00 (America/Los_Angeles)
  UTC:  2026-02-21T22:00:00Z
  Task: Check the build
```

**Recurring output:**
```
Scheduled recurring task (id=e5f6a7b8)
  Cron: 0 10 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)
  Next: Mon 2026-02-23 10:00
  Task: Standup
```

When timezone is UTC, a hint is shown:
```
  Hint: Use --tz to set timezone (e.g. --tz America/New_York)
```

### `ash-sb schedule list`

By default, only shows tasks for the current room (token `chat_id`). Use `--all` to see tasks across all rooms.

```bash
# List tasks in current room (default)
ash-sb schedule list

# List tasks across all rooms
ash-sb schedule list --all
```

**Default output (current room):**
```
Scheduled tasks (times shown in America/Los_Angeles):

  a1b2c3d4  one-shot   Sat 2026-02-21 14:00 (America/Los_Angeles)
           Task: Check the build

  e5f6a7b8  periodic   0 10 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)
           Next: Mon 2026-02-23 10:00
           Task: Standup

Total: 2 task(s)
```

**`--all` output (all rooms):**
```
Scheduled tasks (times shown in America/Los_Angeles):

  a1b2c3d4  one-shot   Sat 2026-02-21 14:00 (America/Los_Angeles)
           Room: Work Chat
           Task: Check the build

  e5f6a7b8  periodic   0 10 * * 1-5 (America/New_York)
           Room: Personal
           Next: Mon 2026-02-23 10:00
           Task: Standup

Total: 2 task(s)
```

If token `chat_id` is not set (non-provider context), all tasks are shown regardless — matching the `--all` behavior.

### `ash-sb schedule cancel`

```bash
ash-sb schedule cancel --id a1b2c3d4
```

**Output:**
```
Cancelled task (id=a1b2c3d4): Check the build
```

### `ash-sb schedule update`

```bash
ash-sb schedule update --id a1b2c3d4 --message "New task text"
ash-sb schedule update --id a1b2c3d4 --at "tomorrow at 10am"
ash-sb schedule update --id a1b2c3d4 --cron "0 9 * * *" --tz America/Los_Angeles
```

**Recurring output:**
```
Updated recurring task (id=e5f6a7b8)
  Cron: 0 9 * * * (America/Los_Angeles)
  Next: Mon 2026-02-23 09:00
  Task: Standup
```

**One-shot output:**
```
Updated reminder (id=a1b2c3d4)
  Time: Tue 2026-02-24 10:00 (America/Los_Angeles)
  UTC:  2026-02-24T18:00:00Z
  Task: New task text
```

## Behavior

### One-Shot
1. Agent runs `ash-sb schedule create "msg" --at TIME`
2. Command calls `schedule.create` RPC; host writes entry to graph storage
3. Watcher detects entry is due
4. Handler creates ephemeral session, runs agent with message
5. Response sent back to original chat
6. Entry deleted from graph storage

### Periodic
1. Agent runs `ash-sb schedule create "msg" --cron "EXPR"`
2. Command calls `schedule.create` RPC; host writes entry to graph storage
3. Watcher calculates next run from cron (and `last_run` if present)
4. Handler creates ephemeral session, runs agent with message
5. Response sent back to original chat
6. `last_run` updated in graph storage, entry preserved for next run

### Update
1. Agent runs `ash-sb schedule update --id ID --message "new text"`
2. RPC validates ownership (user_id must match) and applies changes
3. Cannot switch entry types (one-shot ↔ periodic)
4. `trigger_at` updates must be in the future; `cron` updates must be valid expressions

### No-Retry Semantics

Failed tasks are still marked as processed — one-shot entries are deleted, periodic entries get `last_run` updated. There is no automatic retry. This prevents infinite retry loops for tasks that consistently fail.

### Ownership Rules

- **RPC layer** (sandbox commands): `cancel` and `update` check that the requesting `user_id` matches the entry's `user_id`. Users can only modify their own tasks.
- **CLI commands** (host-side): `ash schedule cancel`, `ash schedule update`, `ash schedule clear` do not check ownership — they are admin commands for the host operator.

## Task Execution Wrapper

When a scheduled task executes, the handler wraps it with timing context so the agent can decide whether the task is still relevant.

### Wrapper Format

The task message is wrapped with XML tags:

- `<context>` - Entry ID, schedule type, scheduled by
- `<timing>` - Current time, scheduled fire time, delay
- `<decision-guidance>` - Rules for skip vs execute
- `<task>` - The original task message

### Time-Sensitive vs Time-Independent

**Time-sensitive tasks** depend on being run close to schedule:
- Greetings tied to time of day ("good morning")
- Reminders for specific moments ("remind me at 2pm")
- Event prompts ("daily standup reminder")

**Time-independent tasks** provide value regardless of delay:
- Data fetching (weather, transit, stocks)
- Reports and summaries
- Backups and syncs

### Skip Decision

The agent uses these thresholds for time-sensitive tasks:
- Delay > 2 hours AND meaning has passed: Skip
- Delay > 4 hours: Almost always skip
- Delay 30 min - 2 hours: Use judgment

Time-independent tasks always execute.

### Output Rules

**If executing:** Run normally, don't mention the delay.

**If skipping:** Brief explanation + next scheduled time if recurring.
Example: "Skipping morning greeting - it's now 3:45 PM. This runs daily at 8 AM."

## Integration

```python
from ash.scheduling import ScheduleStore, ScheduleWatcher, ScheduledTaskHandler

# Create store and watcher
store = ScheduleStore(get_graph_dir())
watcher = ScheduleWatcher(store, timezone="America/Los_Angeles")

# Create handler with agent, senders, registrars, and executor
handler = ScheduledTaskHandler(
    agent=agent,
    senders={"telegram": telegram_provider.send_message},
    registrars={"telegram": telegram_registrar},
    timezone="America/Los_Angeles",
    agent_executor=agent_executor,
)
watcher.add_handler(handler.handle)

# Wire store into RPC for sandbox commands
register_schedule_methods(rpc_server, store)

# Start watching
await watcher.start()
```

## Verification

```bash
# Start server
uv run ash serve

# In Telegram, tell the bot:
"remind me in 2 minutes to check the build"

# Verify entry was created:
cat ~/.ash/graph/schedules.jsonl

# After 2 minutes, bot sends response to the same chat
# Entry is removed from graph schedules
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Graph-backed JSONL storage** - Simple, grepable, git-friendly
2. **State persisted in graph nodes** - `last_run` survives restarts
3. **Delete vs update** - One-shot deleted, periodic updated in place
4. **CLI injects context** - `ash schedule create` adds chat_id/provider from env vars
5. **Provider required** - Requires provider with persistent chat for response routing
6. **Fresh context per task** - Each task runs in ephemeral session
7. **UTC times** - Avoids timezone confusion
8. **Ownership filtering** - Users can only cancel/update their own tasks (RPC layer); listing is scoped by room + user
9. **Time-aware execution** - Agent can skip stale time-sensitive tasks
10. **Timing context** - Handler provides current time, fire time, and delay
11. **No retry** - Failed tasks are marked processed to prevent infinite loops
12. **Room-scoped listing** - `schedule list` defaults to current room's tasks to prevent cross-room data leakage; `--all` shows all rooms with labels
