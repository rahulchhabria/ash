# Capabilities

> Token-authenticated host capability API for sensitive external systems used by skills.

Files: `src/ash/capabilities/`, `src/ash/rpc/methods/capability.py`, `src/ash/integrations/capabilities.py`, `packages/ash-sandbox-cli/src/ash_sandbox_cli/commands/capability.py`

## Status

Core manager/RPC/CLI implementation is in place; provider backends are incremental.

## Intent

Capabilities provide a secure interface for skills to access sensitive external systems
(for example email/calendar) without giving skills direct credentials.

This is the core contract for both bundled and externally distributed capability
providers so skill code can be shared while preserving per-user data and
credential isolation.

## Outcomes

1. Skills invoke host-managed capabilities instead of using long-lived API secrets in env vars.
2. Verified caller context (`ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN`) determines identity/scope for all capability calls.
3. Multiple users can invoke the same skill implementation without cross-user data exposure.
4. Sensitive capability operations are restricted by chat policy (DM-only by default).
5. Auth flows (OAuth/device/browser) are mediated by host APIs and short-lived flow handles.

## Ownership Model

Capabilities can be supplied by two trusted host-controlled paths:

1. **Integration-owned providers (first-party)**: registered by runtime composition
   for primary system capabilities.
2. **External bridge providers**: configured as command bridges (for example, a
   skill-distributed `gogcli` bridge) and executed by host capability infrastructure.

Both paths must use the same namespace, token-derived context, policy checks, and
per-user credential isolation rules.

## Requirements

### MUST

- All capability RPC methods require valid `context_token` and fail closed otherwise.
- Identity/routing for capability execution must come only from verified token claims.
- Caller-provided identity/routing fields (`user_id`, `chat_id`, `chat_type`, etc.) are not trusted.
- External provider execution details (command/container/runtime path) must come from
  host config (`[capabilities.providers.*]`), not from untrusted skill metadata.
- Capability IDs must be globally unique and namespaced as `<namespace>.<name>` (for example `gog.email`).
- Capability RPC requests must use fully-qualified namespaced IDs; unqualified IDs are rejected.
- Bot-initiated capability operations must run through `ash-sb` commands (no direct provider/chat path to credential lookups).
- Skills must not receive capability credentials via environment variables.
- Credential/materialized account state is isolated by verified `effective_user_id` (`sub` claim).
- Capability definitions include access metadata (sensitivity + allowed chat types).
- `sensitive` capabilities default to `private` chat type unless explicitly overridden.
- Capability auth flow handles are short-lived, unguessable, and bound to the requesting user scope.
- Capability execution emits structured audit events without logging raw bearer tokens.
- Capability responses must never include raw credential artifacts (access tokens, refresh tokens, cookie jars, client secrets).
- Provider auth `credential_material` must contain only opaque references/metadata (no raw tokens/secrets).
- Provider-side credential artifacts must be persisted via a dedicated vault abstraction (not graph collections or sandbox-readable mounts).

### SHOULD

- Mutating operations support optional idempotency keys.
- Capability-sidecar/runtime bridges reuse authenticated loopback bearer-token patterns.
- Capability stores separate credential material from operation data/artifacts.
- Flow completion should support callback URL ingestion and manual code fallback.
- Headless deployments should use Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) for auth flows.
  See `specs/capability-auth.md` for the device code flow spec.

### MAY

- Capability-level rate limits and quotas.
- Explicit shared-account delegation across users/chats (opt-in policy only).

## Trust Model

`ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN` establishes *who/where* a call originates. Capabilities add policy
and data isolation on top of that:

1. Verify token and extract trusted claims (`sub`, `chat_id`, `chat_type`, `thread_id`, etc.).
2. Evaluate access policy (skill access + capability access + chat policy).
3. Resolve user-scoped credential/account context.
4. Execute provider operation in host-managed boundary.
5. Return sanitized result to sandbox caller.

The token is necessary but not sufficient; capability-specific auth and isolation are
required for secure multi-user operation.

## Namespacing

Capability surfaces are shared across integrations and external skill repos, so
all identifiers must be namespace-safe.

- Namespace owner: integration/skill package (example: `gog`).
- Capability IDs: `<namespace>.<capability>` (example: `gog.email`, `gog.calendar`).
- Registry behavior: duplicate capability IDs are registration errors.
- Storage keys: include `capability_id` so namespace is part of persistence identity.

This allows multiple integrations to coexist without collisions.

## Access Path Invariant

For agent/bot execution, capability access is constrained to:

`bot tool call -> bash -> ash-sb capability -> RPC (context_token) -> host capability manager`

Important implications:

- `ash-sb` auto-attaches trusted caller context (`ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN`) to RPC requests.
- Host capability manager resolves credential scope from verified token claims.
- Skills and prompt text cannot select another user's credential scope by passing `user_id`.
- Host/provider-side credential APIs are not exposed directly to arbitrary chat interactions.

## Interface

### External Provider Bridge

Capability providers are configured as bridge commands.

For bundled `gog` dogfood, configure from the skill section:

```toml
[skills.google]
enabled = true

[skills.google.capability_provider]
enabled = true
namespace = "gog"
command = ["gogcli", "bridge"]
timeout_seconds = 30
```

`skills.google.enabled = true` applies default `capabilities.providers.gog` wiring.
Optional `skills.google.capability_provider` values override command/namespace/timeout.
Explicit `[capabilities.providers.gog]` remains available for host-level overrides.

The host invokes the bridge with JSON over stdin/stdout for `definitions`,
`auth_begin`, `auth_complete`, `auth_poll`, and `invoke`.
(`auth_poll` is defined in `specs/capability-auth.md`.)

Skill metadata declares required capability IDs only; it does not select the
provider command/container/runtime.

#### Bridge Envelope (`bridge-v1`)

Every request/response uses a strict envelope:

Request:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "cap_bridge_abc123",
  "namespace": "gog",
  "method": "invoke",
  "params": {}
}
```

Response (success):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "cap_bridge_abc123",
  "result": {}
}
```

Response (error):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "cap_bridge_abc123",
  "error": {
    "code": "capability_backend_unavailable",
    "message": "bridge offline"
  }
}
```

Validation rules:

- `version` MUST be `1`.
- `id` MUST match request `id`.
- Response MUST contain exactly one of `result` or `error`.
- `result` MUST be a JSON object.
- `error` MUST be an object with non-empty `code` and `message`.
- Envelope violations fail closed with `capability_invalid_output`.

Bridge method params:

- `definitions`: no caller context fields required.
- `auth_begin`, `auth_complete`, `invoke`: params MUST include `context_token`
  (host-issued signed token carrying caller scope claims).
- Host runtime MUST provide `ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN_SECRET` to the bridge subprocess
  environment so trusted external providers can verify tokens cryptographically.
- Bridge requests MUST NOT include raw caller identity/routing objects such as
  `{ "context": { "user_id": ..., "chat_id": ... } }`.
- External bridge runtimes SHOULD verify `context_token` cryptographically before
  trusting caller scope claims.

### Capability Definition

```python
@dataclass
class CapabilityDefinition:
    id: str  # required namespaced id, e.g. "gog.email"
    description: str
    sensitive: bool = False
    allowed_chat_types: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # empty => all
    operations: dict[str, CapabilityOperation] = field(default_factory=dict)


@dataclass
class CapabilityOperation:
    name: str
    description: str
    requires_auth: bool = True
    mutating: bool = False
    input_schema: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)   # JSON Schema
    output_schema: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)  # JSON Schema
```

### Provider Contract

Provider integrations register a namespace-owned capability surface and execute
auth/invoke behavior inside host-managed boundaries.

```python
@dataclass
class CapabilityCallContext:
    user_id: str
    chat_id: str | None
    chat_type: str | None
    provider: str | None
    thread_id: str | None
    session_key: str | None
    source_username: str | None
    source_display_name: str | None


class CapabilityProvider(Protocol):
    @property
    def namespace(self) -> str: ...
    async def definitions(self) -> list[CapabilityDefinition]: ...
    async def auth_begin(...) -> CapabilityAuthBeginResult: ...
    async def auth_complete(...) -> CapabilityAuthCompleteResult: ...
    async def auth_poll(...) -> CapabilityAuthPollResult: ...  # specs/capability-auth.md
    async def invoke(...) -> dict[str, Any]: ...
```

Rules:

- Provider namespace must match capability ID prefix (`namespace.*`).
- Provider responses are user-facing payloads and must be credential-safe.
- Host rejects provider outputs containing credential-like keys (`access_token`,
  `refresh_token`, `id_token`, `client_secret`, cookie/auth headers).
- Host rejects provider auth `credential_material` containing credential-like keys.

### RPC Methods

#### `capability.list`

Returns capabilities visible to the verified caller context.

Request params:

```json
{
  "include_unavailable": false,
  "context_token": "<signed-token>"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "gog.email",
      "description": "Email operations",
      "available": true,
      "requires_auth": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `capability.invoke`

Executes one operation under verified caller scope.

Request params:

```json
{
  "capability": "gog.email",
  "operation": "list_messages",
  "input": {"folder": "inbox", "limit": 20},
  "idempotency_key": "optional-client-key",
  "context_token": "<signed-token>"
}
```

All identity/routing fields are derived from verified token claims; caller-provided
values are ignored.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "output": {"messages": []},
  "request_id": "cap_01..."
}
```

#### `capability.auth.begin`

Starts auth for a capability/account and returns an auth flow handle.
For device code flow extensions (`flow_type`, `user_code`, `auth_poll`), see `specs/capability-auth.md`.

If an unexpired pending auth flow already exists for the same caller scope
(`effective_user_id`, `capability`, `account_hint`), the host returns that
existing flow instead of creating a new one.

Request params:

```json
{
  "capability": "gog.email",
  "account_hint": "work",
  "context_token": "<signed-token>"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "flow_id": "caf_01...",
  "auth_url": "https://...",
  "expires_at": "2026-02-24T20:10:00Z"
}
```

#### `capability.auth.complete`

Completes a pending auth flow with callback URL or code.

Request params:

```json
{
  "flow_id": "caf_01...",
  "callback_url": "https://localhost/callback?code=...",
  "code": "optional-direct-auth-code",
  "context_token": "<signed-token>"
}
```

Normalization rules (host-owned, provider-independent):

- Accept `code`, `callback_url`, or both.
- If both are provided and disagree, fail with `capability_auth_code_conflict`.
- If callback `state` is present and mismatches stored flow state, fail with `capability_auth_state_mismatch`.
- If no usable code can be resolved, fail with `capability_auth_code_missing`.

Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "account_ref": "acct_work"
}
```

#### `capability.auth.list`

Lists pending auth flows for the verified caller so follow-up callback/code messages can
complete an existing flow without restarting auth.

Request params:

```json
{
  "capability": "gog.calendar",
  "account_hint": "work",
  "context_token": "<signed-token>"
}
```

`capability` and `account_hint` are optional filters.

Response:

```json
{
  "flows": [
    {
      "flow_id": "caf_01...",
      "capability": "gog.calendar",
      "account_hint": "work",
      "auth_url": "https://...",
      "expires_at": "2026-02-24T20:10:00Z",
      "flow_type": "authorization_code"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### `capability.auth.poll`

Polls a pending device code auth flow. See `specs/capability-auth.md` for full contract.

### Sandbox CLI Contract (`ash-sb capability`)

- `ash-sb capability list`
- `ash-sb capability invoke --capability <id> --operation <name> --input-json <json>`
- `ash-sb capability auth begin --capability <id> [--account <hint>]`
- `ash-sb capability auth list [--capability <id>] [--account <hint>]`
- `ash-sb capability auth complete --flow-id <id> (--callback-url <url> | --code <code>)`
- `ash-sb capability auth poll --flow-id <id> [--timeout <secs>] [--interval <secs>]`
  (See `specs/capability-auth.md`.)

All commands must use the same `ASH_CONTEXT_TOKEN` trust chain as other sandbox CLI
commands. No direct credential env vars are a supported auth path.
The command layer carries identity context; the host resolves credentials internally.

## Policy Layering

Capability invocation is allowed only when all policy gates pass:

1. Skill-level access policy (for example `sensitive`, `access.chat_types`, `allow_chat_ids`, declared `capabilities`).
2. Capability-level access policy (sensitivity/chat-type constraints).
3. Capability operation preconditions (auth present, required inputs, provider health).

A deny at any layer must fail closed with a deterministic error.

## Data Isolation

Capability state is scoped to verified identity and namespace:

- Credential key space: `(effective_user_id, capability_id, account_ref)`
- Operation state/artifacts: at least `(effective_user_id, capability_id)`
- Optional chat-scoped data: additionally keyed by verified `chat_id`

Cross-user reads/writes are always denied unless an explicit sharing policy exists.

## Browser/Auth Bridge Unification

When capability auth/execution needs sidecar processes, use the same security model as
the browser bridge:

- Loopback-only bridge
- Short-lived signed token authentication with scope/target claims
- Scope-keyed runtime/container identity
- No unauthenticated control channel

See `specs/browser.md` for runtime bridge invariants.

## Errors

| Condition | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| Capability not found | `capability_not_found` |
| Access denied by chat policy | `capability_access_denied` |
| Auth required but missing | `capability_auth_required` |
| Auth flow expired/invalid | `capability_auth_flow_invalid` |
| Device auth flow expired | `capability_auth_flow_expired` |
| Device auth flow denied by user | `capability_auth_flow_denied` |
| Callback URL malformed | `capability_auth_callback_invalid` |
| Callback/code mismatch | `capability_auth_code_conflict` |
| Callback state mismatch | `capability_auth_state_mismatch` |
| Missing authorization code | `capability_auth_code_missing` |
| Invalid input schema | `capability_invalid_input` |
| Upstream/provider unavailable | `capability_backend_unavailable` |

## Verification

- Unit tests for capability manager auth/policy enforcement.
- Unit tests for provider namespace ownership/delegation/output hardening.
- RPC tests proving caller identity fields are token-derived only.
- Sandbox CLI tests for `ash-sb capability` command contracts.
- Integration tests for multi-user isolation (same skill, different users).
- Integration tests for sensitive capability DM-only default behavior.
