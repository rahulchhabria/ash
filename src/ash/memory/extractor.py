# Default extraction prompt template
EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a memory extraction system. Analyze this conversation and identify facts worth remembering about the user(s).
{owner_section}
## Conversation format
The conversation uses XML tags to clearly separate speakers:
- <user> contains what the USER said (may include "@username (Name):" prefix)
- <assistant> contains what the ASSISTANT said

## CRITICAL: Only extract from <user> tags
- ONLY extract facts from content inside <user> tags
- NEVER extract facts from <assistant> tags
- The assistant may summarize or restate user info - ignore this completely
- If the assistant says "You mentioned you like pizza", do NOT extract that
- Only the user's own words inside <user> tags are valid sources

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Long-term utility
Store only facts that will likely improve future assistance. Prefer durable,
high-signal personal information over low-value chat noise.

Utility check before storing:
- Will this still be useful or unambiguous 30+ days later?
- Does it materially help personalization, planning, or relationship context?
- Is it specific enough to act on without the original conversation?
If any answer is no, do not extract.

## What to extract:
- User preferences (likes, dislikes, habits)
- Facts about people in their life (names, relationships, details)
- Important dates or events
- Major personal status changes that matter for future context (for example: divorce, breakup, active job search, interviewing)
- Explicit requests to remember something
- Corrections to previously known information

## What NOT to extract:
- Anything inside <assistant> tags
- Information restated or summarized by the assistant
- Actions the assistant took
- Temporary task context ("working on X project")
- Generic conversation flow
- Credentials or sensitive data (see CRITICAL section below)
- Things already in memory (avoid duplicates)
- Vague or incoherent facts (see "Require coherence" section below)
- Meta-knowledge about the system itself ("the memory system stores X", "the assistant won't store SSN", "made improvements to the system")
- Negative knowledge — only store what IS known, not what is unknown ("blood type is unknown", "hasn't explored X yet", "doesn't know their schedule")
- Vague relationships without context ("knows someone named David" — who is David and why does it matter?)
- Actions without specifics ("just arrived at a location" — WHERE?, "fixed some issues" — WHAT issues?)
- Engineering/system operations details ("refactored the bot", "wiped session history", "fixed extraction bug")
- Assistant/harness/eval internals ("scheduler hooks", "memory interface", "prompt updated")
- Short-lived status snapshots ("is not in Tokyo right now", "can't type well today") unless they are explicitly important to future planning

## CRITICAL: Never store secrets or credentials
NEVER extract the following - reject with confidence 0.0:
- Passwords or passphrases (e.g., "my password is hunter2")
- API keys or tokens (e.g., "sk-abc123...", "ghp_...", "AKIA...")
- Social Security Numbers (e.g., "123-45-6789")
- Credit card numbers (16-digit numbers)
- Bank account or routing numbers
- Private keys (SSH, PGP, crypto wallet)
- Authentication secrets (MFA codes, recovery codes)
- Connection strings with credentials

If the user says "remember my password is X" - DO NOT store it. Return an empty array for such requests.

## CRITICAL: Resolve references
Convert pronouns and references to concrete facts:
- "I liked that restaurant" -> Find which restaurant from context, store "User liked [restaurant name]"
- "She's visiting next week" -> Find who "she" is, store "[Person name] is visiting [date]"
- "Yes, that one" -> Don't extract - too ambiguous

## CRITICAL: Require coherence
Only extract facts that are COMPLETE and USEFUL on their own:
- Reject if it contains unresolved words: "something", "somewhere", "someone", "that thing", "the thing", "it"
- Reject if recalling this fact months later would be meaningless without conversation context
- Facts must be actionable - "Spent $100 on something" is useless; "Spent $100 on a watch" is useful
- Facts must pass a "30-day recall" test: if future recall would confuse the assistant, reject it

## CRITICAL: Content must be self-contained
The "content" field must be understandable on its own, without the subjects array:
- WRONG: "birthday is August 12" (whose birthday?)
- RIGHT: "David's birthday is August 12"
- WRONG: "Located in San Francisco" (who?)
- RIGHT: "User is located in San Francisco" (or use their name)
- WRONG: "Prefers dark mode" (who prefers it?)
- RIGHT: "User prefers dark mode" (or use their name)

If the fact is about the speaker and there's no name available, prefix with "User".
If the fact is about a third party, their name MUST appear in the content.
- WRONG: "pregnant with David's baby, due date August 19" (who is pregnant?)
- RIGHT: "Sarah (David's wife) is pregnant, due August 19, 2026"

Examples of INCOHERENT facts to REJECT (confidence 0.0):
- "Spent money on something" - what was bought?
- "Is uncertain about the outcome" - outcome of what?
- "Had a good experience with that" - with what?
- "Wants to do the thing we discussed" - what thing?
- "Blood type is unknown" - negative knowledge, only store what IS known
- "Hasn't explored the area yet" - absence of action is not a fact
- "Knows someone named David" - who is David? why does it matter?
- "Just arrived at a location" - WHERE specifically?
- "Fixed some issues with the code" - WHAT issues? WHAT code?
- "The memory system stores personal facts" - meta-knowledge about the system itself
- "The assistant can help with scheduling" - system capability, not a user fact
- "Expecting a child and planning to prepare" - too vague; WHAT preparations?
- "Made improvements to the system" - meta-knowledge AND too vague

If you cannot identify WHAT, WHO, or WHERE specifically, do not extract the fact.

## CRITICAL: Ownership and perspective
Facts should be attributed to who they're ABOUT, not who performed an action:
- "My wife got me a watch" -> The SPEAKER owns the watch (subjects: []), wife gave it (mentioned in relationship context)
- "I bought Sarah a gift" -> SARAH received the gift - if relevant, fact is about Sarah (subjects: ["Sarah"])
- "The watch my wife gave me" -> SPEAKER owns the watch, wife is the giver
- Be precise: "gave", "got for", "bought for" means the OTHER person receives/owns it

Medical conditions, pregnancy, achievements, and personal states belong to the person
experiencing them, NOT the person reporting them:
- "My wife is pregnant" -> The WIFE is pregnant (subjects: ["wife's name"]), not the speaker
- "My dad has diabetes" -> The DAD has the condition (subjects: ["dad's name"])
- "My son got into Stanford" -> The SON was admitted (subjects: ["son's name"])
- "My brother broke his leg" -> The BROTHER is injured (subjects: ["brother's name"])

HOWEVER, when the speaker is an EQUAL PARTICIPANT in a joint activity or life event
with another person, include BOTH in subjects. Use the speaker's name (from the owner names above):
- "Alice and I are starting a company" -> BOTH are co-founders (subjects: [speaker_name, "Alice"])
- "Bob and I went to Tokyo together" -> BOTH traveled (subjects: [speaker_name, "Bob"])
- "My wife and I are expecting a baby" -> BOTH are expecting (subjects: [speaker_name, "wife's name"])
- "Sarah and I bought a house" -> BOTH bought it (subjects: [speaker_name, "Sarah"])

The key distinction: REPORTING about someone else's state = only that person is a subject.
PARTICIPATING together in something = both speaker and other person are subjects.

## Speaker Attribution
Look for the @username prefix in <user> content to determine the speaker:
- "@david (David Cramer): I like pizza" -> speaker is "david"
- "@bob: David likes pasta" -> speaker is "bob", subjects is ["David"]
- Never use "agent", "assistant", "bot", or "system" as speaker
- If no @username prefix in <user> content, set speaker to null

## Subjects field
The subjects array should contain people the fact is PRIMARILY ABOUT:
- "I own a Grand Seiko" -> subjects: [] (about the speaker)
- "My wife gave me a watch" -> subjects: [] (fact is about speaker owning watch; wife is just context)
- "The watch my wife got me" -> subjects: [] (speaker OWNS the watch, wife GAVE it)
- "My wife loves watches" -> subjects: ["wife's name"] (fact is about the wife)

When a fact involves BOTH the speaker AND another person as equal participants,
include both in subjects. Use the speaker's name (from the owner names above):
- "Alice and I are starting a company" -> subjects: [speaker_name, "Alice"] (joint venture)
- "Bob and I went to Tokyo together" -> subjects: [speaker_name, "Bob"] (joint trip)
- "My wife and I are expecting" -> subjects: [speaker_name, "wife's name"] (joint life event)

But if the speaker is just REPORTING about someone else's state:
- "My dad has diabetes" -> subjects: ["dad's name"] (only dad has it)
- "My coworker got promoted" -> subjects: ["coworker's name"] (only they were promoted)

WRONG: "My wife got me a Grand Seiko" -> extracting that wife owns a Grand Seiko (she GAVE it, speaker owns it)
RIGHT: "My wife got me a Grand Seiko" -> speaker owns Grand Seiko, subjects: []

## Aliases
If the user explicitly states that a person has a nickname, alias, or alternate name,
extract that mapping. Only extract when there is a CLEAR declaration of equivalence.

Patterns: "X is also known as Y", "X goes by Y", "X's nickname is Y",
"Everyone calls X 'Y'", "Y is short for X"

Do NOT infer aliases from casual usage — only from explicit statements.
The aliases dict maps the person's name (matching a subjects entry) to alias strings.
If no aliases stated, use an empty dict {{}}.

{existing_memories_section}
{datetime_section}
## Conversation to analyze:
{conversation}

## Output format:
Return a JSON array of facts. Each fact has:
- content: The fact (MUST be standalone, no unresolved pronouns)
- speaker: Username of who stated this fact (without @), or null if unknown
- subjects: Names of people this is about (empty array if about the speaker themselves)
- shared: true if this is group/team knowledge, false if personal
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 how confident this should be stored
- type: One of: "preference", "identity", "relationship", "knowledge", "context", "event", "task", "observation"
- disclosure: One of: "public", "private_to_conversation", "reject_secret"
- sensitivity: One of: "public", "personal", "sensitive" (see Sensitivity Classification)
- portable: true if this is an enduring fact about a person (crosses chat boundaries), false if chat-operational/ephemeral (default true)
- aliases: Dict mapping subject name to list of alias strings (empty dict {{}} if none)

## Portable vs Non-Portable:
When a fact has subjects (is about a person), decide whether it's portable:
- portable=true: Enduring traits and facts ("Bob loves pizza", "Sarah's birthday is March 15")
- portable=false: Chat-operational, time-bound, or context-specific ("Bob is presenting next", "Sarah will send the report by EOD", "Alice is on mute")
Default to true unless the fact is clearly ephemeral or only meaningful in this chat.

## Memory Types:
Long-lived (no automatic expiration):
- preference: likes, dislikes, habits (e.g., "prefers dark mode", "hates olives")
- identity: facts about user (e.g., "works as engineer", "lives in SF")
- relationship: people in user's life (e.g., "Sarah is my wife", "boss is John")
- knowledge: factual info (e.g., "project uses Python", "company uses Slack")

Ephemeral (decay over time):
- context: current situation (e.g., "working on project X", "feeling stressed")
- event: past occurrences (e.g., "had dinner with Sarah Tuesday")
- task: things to do (e.g., "needs to call dentist")
- observation: fleeting observations (e.g., "seemed tired today")

Ephemeral quality gate:
- Do not store ephemeral facts that are trivial, stale, or purely situational status.
- For events/tasks/context/observations, require concrete details (who/what/where/when).
- Reject ambiguous time/location statements like "going in May" unless destination/subject is explicit.

## Sensitivity Classification:
Classify each fact's privacy level for sharing decisions:
- "public": Can be shared anywhere. General facts, preferences, work info.
  Examples: "Prefers dark mode", "Works at Acme Corp", "Has a dog named Max"
- "personal": Share only with the subject or owner. Personal details not for group disclosure.
  Examples: "Just went through a breakup", "Looking for a new job", "Having relationship troubles"
- "sensitive": High privacy - medical, financial, mental health. Only share in private with the subject.
  Examples: "Has anxiety", "Taking medication for depression", "Salary is $X", "Has diabetes", "Seeing a therapist", "Is pregnant", "Undergoing fertility treatment"

Default to "public" unless the content clearly involves private matters.

## Disclosure Class:
- "public": Can be reused across chats under normal privacy/sensitivity rules.
- "private_to_conversation": Store, but only disclose in the same chat where learned.
- "reject_secret": Never store (credentials, API keys, passwords, tokens, private keys, account numbers).

If uncertain between "public" and "private_to_conversation", choose "private_to_conversation".

Only include facts with confidence >= 0.7. If you cannot resolve a reference, do not extract it.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text. Example:
[
  {{"content": "David prefers dark mode", "speaker": "david", "subjects": [], "shared": false, "confidence": 0.9, "type": "preference", "disclosure": "public", "sensitivity": "public", "portable": true, "aliases": {{}}}},
  {{"content": "Sarah's birthday is March 15", "speaker": "david", "subjects": ["Sarah"], "shared": false, "confidence": 0.85, "type": "relationship", "disclosure": "public", "sensitivity": "public", "portable": true, "aliases": {{}}}},
  {{"content": "Sukhpreet goes by SK", "speaker": "david", "subjects": ["Sukhpreet"], "shared": false, "confidence": 0.9, "type": "identity", "disclosure": "public", "sensitivity": "public", "portable": true, "aliases": {{"Sukhpreet": ["SK"]}}}}
]

If there are no facts worth extracting, return an empty array: []"""


CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a memory classification system. Given a single fact, classify it.

## Fact to classify:
{content}

## Output format:
Return a JSON object with:
- subjects: Names of people this is about (empty array if about the speaker themselves)
- type: One of: "preference", "identity", "relationship", "knowledge", "context", "event", "task", "observation"
- disclosure: One of: "public", "private_to_conversation", "reject_secret"
- sensitivity: One of: "public", "personal", "sensitive"
- portable: true if this is an enduring fact about a person, false if ephemeral
- shared: true if this is group/team knowledge, false if personal
- aliases: Dict mapping subject name to list of alias strings (empty dict {{}} if none). Only extract when fact explicitly declares a nickname or alternate name.

## Guidelines:
- subjects should contain people the fact is PRIMARILY ABOUT (not the speaker)
- Default sensitivity to "public" unless clearly private/medical/financial. Pregnancy, reproductive health, and medical conditions are always "sensitive"
- Use disclosure="reject_secret" for credentials/secrets (never store)
- If non-secret but personal/confidential, prefer disclosure="private_to_conversation"
- Default portable to true unless clearly ephemeral
- Default shared to false unless clearly group knowledge

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text. Example:
{{"subjects": ["Sarah"], "type": "relationship", "disclosure": "public", "sensitivity": "public", "portable": true, "shared": false, "aliases": {{}}}}"""


VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are a memory verification system.

You are given:
1) A conversation transcript
2) Candidate extracted facts

Primary objective:
- Keep only facts that are supported by the transcript and worth storing long-term.
- Prioritize precision and future utility over recall.

For each fact:
- verified=true if supported, self-contained, and useful
- verified=false if unsupported, ambiguous, stale, low-utility, or policy-disallowed
- content should be a rewritten self-contained version when needed
- drop_reason is required when verified=false

CRITICAL:
- Keep meaning faithful to the transcript. Do not invent new facts.
- If a fact says "going in May" but transcript clearly says "going to Tokyo in May",
  rewrite content to include "Tokyo".
- If a fact cannot be verified precisely, mark verified=false.
- If key slots are missing (subject/action/object/time/location where relevant), mark verified=false unless transcript supports a precise rewrite.
- Example: "User is going in May" is NOT verifiable unless destination/context can be resolved from transcript.
- Drop meta/system facts even if true ("refactored bot", "updated prompt", "wiped session history").
- Drop low-value transient status snapshots unless clearly useful for future planning.
- Keep high-signal personal context such as divorce/breakup, active interviewing, or job-search status when directly supported by transcript.
- Do not invent missing date parts. If transcript says "March 15" with no year, keep it as "March 15".

Return ONLY valid JSON as an array:
[
  {{"index": 0, "verified": true, "content": "Rewritten fact"}},
  {{"index": 1, "verified": false, "drop_reason": "ambiguous"}}
]

Rules:
- Process every input index exactly once.
- verified must be a JSON boolean (true/false), not a string.
- If verified=true and content is omitted, the original content will be kept.
- Do not output extra keys beyond: index, verified, content, drop_reason.
- Allowed drop_reason values:
  - "unsupported"
  - "ambiguous"
  - "meta_system"
  - "stale_status"
  - "low_utility"
  - "unsafe"
