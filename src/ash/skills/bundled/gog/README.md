# Bundled `google` Bridge

This directory contains the capability provider bridge for Gmail/Calendar
workflows. The skill instructions live in `src/ash/integrations/skills/capabilities/google/SKILL.md`.

## What Is Here

- `scripts/gogcli_bridge.py`: bridge runtime implementing the capability provider
  subprocess contract (`bridge-v1`).

The bridge is exposed through the packaged CLI entrypoint:

```bash
gogcli bridge
```

## Getting Started

**Prerequisite**: Your Google Cloud OAuth client must be "Desktop" type (not "TVs and Limited Input devices"). Desktop clients support authorization code flow with loopback redirects, which is required for Calendar and Gmail scopes.

Add this to `config.toml`:

```toml
[skills.google]
enabled = true
```

That's it. The capability provider bridge is auto-wired when the skill is enabled.

Start a private chat (`ash chat`) and ask the agent about your email or calendar —
it will check auth status and walk you through Google OAuth setup on first use.

Optional chat allowlist guardrails:

```toml
[skills.defaults]
allow_chat_ids = ["<dm-chat-id>"]

# or per-skill override:
[skills.google]
enabled = true
allow_chat_ids = ["<dm-chat-id>"]
```

## Security Model

The google skill is intentionally split into two parts:

- Skill layer (`SKILL.md`): untrusted prompt/instruction surface.
- Host/provider layer (`gogcli bridge`): trusted runtime boundary for auth and
  operations.

Security invariants:

- Skill operations go through `ash-sb capability ...` (not direct credentials).
- Caller identity/scope comes from signed `context_token` verification, not
  caller-provided `user_id`/`chat_id`.
- Sensitive capabilities are DM-only by policy (`private` chat type).
- Account/credential state is user-scoped by verified identity.
- OAuth exchange artifacts and credential material are stored in host vault
  records (state keeps only vault references).
- Provider responses must not include raw OAuth artifacts.

## Runtime Paths

By default, the bridge stores:

- provider state at `~/.ash/gogcli/state.json`
- credential artifacts in the host vault at `~/.ash/vault`

For isolated local testing, override before launching Ash:

```bash
export GOGCLI_STATE_PATH=/tmp/ash-gog/state.json
export GOGCLI_VAULT_PATH=/tmp/ash-gog/vault
```

## Testing

Contract/integration tests (no external Google dependency):

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_gogcli_bridge.py tests/test_gog_capability_e2e.py
```

Interactive local check:

1. Enable `[skills.google]` in `config.toml`.
2. Start chat (`ash chat`) in a private context.
3. Ask the agent to check your email — it will verify capabilities, handle auth, and invoke.

Current behavior note: the bundled bridge is a dogfood/reference provider. It
validates auth/isolation contracts and returns deterministic sample outputs for
email/calendar operations.

## Notes

- This is bundled for first-party dogfooding.
- The contract remains the same as installed/workspace skills and capability
  providers.
